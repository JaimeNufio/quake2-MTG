## Overview:
* Guns are replaced by spells and lands.
* There are three colors of lands, and 3 decks in this mod. These decks are of two colors each. (Rakdos, Izzet, Dimir)
* Every 30 seconds, there is a simultaneous upkeep/untap/draw step. Additionally, there is a "cleanup" step here, where the player's hand size is reduced to a size of 7 if it is greater than 7.
* Some spells maintain their utility as weapons from the base game.
* Pressing F1 will give some more organized info on your hand and board state.
* Players may play any number of lands per turn.
